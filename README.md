# Modular Synthesizer Interface

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an accessible interface for an open-source modular synthesizer, designed to allow novice users to produce a wide range of sounds. The interface leverages web and audio technologies to provide a user-friendly platform for sonic exploration and performance.

## Installation
To run the synthesizer interface, follow these steps:

1. **Install Flask for Python:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

## Usage
After installing Flask, you can run the server by executing the following command:

```bash
python server.py


The System will then be opened in a browser but if renavigation is required head to:

[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
